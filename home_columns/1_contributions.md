## [Obsidian Nice KBDs](https://github.com/andyzito/obsidian-nice-kbds)

This Obsidian plugin automatically detects keyboard shortcuts and wraps them in `<kbd>` tags, indicating a 'keyboard input'. For example, `⌘ + A` becomes <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>, making keyboard combinations clear and visually distinct (styles included).

Additionally, this plugin introduces a unique Markdown syntax for manually specifying keyboard inputs: `«CMD»` will become <kbd>CMD</kbd>.
