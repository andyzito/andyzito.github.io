## [ChatGPT Improvements](https://github.com/andyzito/chatgpt-improvements)

Some custom JavaScript and CSS, created in collaboration with ChatGPT, that provides a set of improved features on the default ChatGPT web interface. Examples include working `<spoiler>` tags, resizable chat box, and submission only on `CTRL + Enter`. This one was mostly just for fun.

Syntree is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to draw syntax trees using an intuitive GUI interface. Extensive documentation is available on [the Syntree website](http://syntree.andycodesthings.com/pages/what.php).

## [HarvestBuddy](https://github.com/andyzito/harvest_buddy)

HarvestBuddy is a prototype command line tool which allows users of the [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) time tracking software to arbitrarily categorize tasks and create per-task hours budgets. It was created for personal use while I was working at [Green River](https://www.greenriver.com/).

## [Markovinator](https://markovinator.andycodesthings.com) [GitHub »](https://github.com/andyzito/markovinator)

Rhyminator is a small React App created primarily for practice. The user is prompted with a word and must list words that rhyme. There is also a mode for listing words that start with a given letter.
